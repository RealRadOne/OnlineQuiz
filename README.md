# OnlineQuiz
The website provides a platform to conduct MCQ based online quizzes amongst various teams (currently 4) along with the provision of computerised marking scheme. It can be personalised accordingly based on the user requirements.
The quiz currently has 3 rounds with 20 questions each (Round 1 and 2- 2 marks for each correct answer; Round 3- 5 marks for each correct answer). If there is a tie at the end of the 3rd round, a tie-breaker round pops up with 12 questions, 2 marks each.
This quiz was designed for an online event conducted by the Law School during our college's annual tech-fest TechnoVIT 2018.
